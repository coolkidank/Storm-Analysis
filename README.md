# Storm-Analysis
Storm analysis involves the systematic examination of meteorological data to understand the patterns, intensity, and impact of storms. This analysis leverages data such as wind speed, storm duration, affected regions, and severity categories to assess storm behavior. By employing advanced data visualization tool like Tableau, I was able to identify trends to predict future storm occurrences, and evaluate their potential risks.

Reason For Storm Analysis
This process plays a critical role in climate change research and disaster preparedness by providing actionable insights for policymakers, emergency response teams, and environmental organizations. It enables the development of mitigation strategies, resource allocation plans, and community resilience measures to minimize the adverse effects of storms.
